# Churn Modelling!

## Enviroment Setup
During the workshop we will be using jupyter notebook with Pytorch framework. Please follow the instructions below and install all resources needed to complete the workshop.


1. Download the repository, you can do it by git(if installed)
    * Open command line in directory where you want to put the repository
    * Type ```git clone https://github.com/marcinswiniarski20/Churn-Modelling.git```
2. Setup Conda Enviroment
    1. [Download Anaconda Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) - package version management system, it includes jupyter notebook and other packages needed to complete the workshop
    2. Once Anaconda have installed, open `Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3)`, you should be able to find it by `win+search`
    <!-- 3. Create conda enviroment with python 3.7 and default name "ML-workshop" simply by: <br/>
    `conda create -n ML-workshop python=3.7` <br/> -->
    <!-- 4. Activate conda enviroment (to use the enviroment which we created above it needs to be activated): <br/>
    `conda activate ML-workshop` <br/> -->
    3. [Install PyTorch with all required packages](https://pytorch.org/): <br/> 
    for CPU version: `conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch`

    4. Go to folder with the installed repository in Anaconda Prompt console (e.g. `cd repos/Churn-Modelling`) <br/>
        <!-- * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` - "requirements.txt" file should be present in directory -->
    5. Run jupyter notebook: <br/>
    `jupyter lab workshop.ipynb` <br/>
    After that jupyter notebook should run in your browser.
3. Test if everything is configured well simply by running already created cell in workshop.ipynb.
